# comm4190_F25_TikTok_Task

In this project we analyzed 1000 comments on a TikTok into a datset around the controversy of the Starbucks Bear Cup. While some costumers loved the design and wanted the cup in their hands, the other half believed it was unreasonably priced and added to wasteful consumerism. Coding the comments into concept 1 and 2, concept 1 expressing negative associations about the cup and concept 2 expressing positive emotions, we were able to train an LLM algorithm using specified prompting to apply our classification method of 100 comments to the rest of the comments. In doing so, we realized the more detail we provided the LLM in prompting, the more accurate or similar it coded comments like we manually did - so the more accurate our algorithm became.

After sorting the data, we were able to analyze findings using graphs and visualizations to explore patterns among the data. In doing so, we answered the question - "Which combinations of sentiments were most common and what type of interactions (likes, replies) were these sentiments associated with?" We found Data analysis using LLMs is a powerful tool and this project provides a glimpse into its application.
